Byggern h√∏st 2021 &lt;3 &lt;3  We can do it!

Project over a semster where we ended up building a ping pong game.
The project consists of two nodes, one on an ATmega 162 and one on Arduino Due.

The project consistet of 9 excerises that guided us through the process of making the system.
1: Initial assembly of microcontroller and RS-232
2: Address decoding and external RAM
3: A/D converting and joystick input
4: OLED display and user interface
5: SPI and CAN controller
6: Getting started with ARM cortex-M3 and communication between nodes
7: Controlling servo and IR
8: Controlling motor and solenoid
9: Completion of project and extras
