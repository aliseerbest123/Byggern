<br />
Project over a semster where we ended up building a ping pong game.<br />
The project consists of two nodes, one on an ATmega 162 and one on Arduino Due.<br />
<br />
The project consistet of 9 excerises that guided us through the process of making the system. <br />
1: Initial assembly of microcontroller and RS-232 <br />
2: Address decoding and external RAM <br />
3: A/D converting and joystick input <br />
4: OLED display and user interface<br />
5: SPI and CAN controller<br />
6: Getting started with ARM cortex-M3 and communication between nodes<br />
7: Controlling servo and IR<br />
8: Controlling motor and solenoid<br />
9: Completion of project and extras<br />
